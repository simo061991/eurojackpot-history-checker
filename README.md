# EuroJackpot History Checker

This web application allows users to check EuroJackpot draws and see when their selected combination of 5 main numbers and 2 Euro numbers has been drawn in the past. The application fetches historical data from a JSON file and provides users with relevant results.

## Features
- Select 5 main numbers (from 1 to 50) and 2 Euro numbers (from 1 to 12).
- Get a list of historical draws where at least 2 main and 1 Euro number matched.
- Results are sorted by the highest number of matches (e.g., `5+2` matched will be shown before `2+1`).
- Simple and intuitive interface for selecting numbers and viewing results.
